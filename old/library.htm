The church library is open when there is a church service.  On Sunday mornings it is open before Sunday School and again after Sunday School is dismissed.  Anyone may check out a book or video from our extensive collection.  We have a book on just about any subject from finance to Christian Living.  There is also a nice assortment of biographies on various people including Billy Graham and James Dobson.
<P>
We have recently added a music library.  There are numerous CD’s from various musical artists.  Plus we also have books on audio as well.  The library will be expanding its DVD collection this year.

The church library is a great source of materials to be used in your Sunday School class or in your private time at home.  I encourage you to check out the wonderful media opportunities that the library has to offer.
