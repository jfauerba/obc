	The WMU now known as the Listening Hearts is an organization dedicated to the mission field.  We have many mission-oriented projects that we are involved  with  throughout the year.  Our two major projects are the Lottie Moon and Annie Armstrong offerings.
	We have a special group of ladies who love the Lord.  Our monthly meetings take place in the church fellowship hall, lower level of second building.  The meetings consist of bible study, prayer, and refreshments.  Also, we discuss business and upcoming projects.
	We certainly welcome any new lady who would like to be a part of our fine group.  We meet the second Tuesday of every month.  Our highlights are the annual July salad supper and Christmas gathering which are held every year.  At the Christmas gathering we reveal our secret pals. 
	Contact Jean Hensley for more information.
